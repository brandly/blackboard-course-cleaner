Here's a short script I wrote for my father. When you create a new course in Blackboard, it adds a lot of stuff to the course by default. He wants to start with a clean slate.

To use it as a bookmarklet, make a new bookmark and, in place of a URL, put `javascript:` followed by the contents of `course-cleaner.min.js`.

#### development

```shell
$ npm run build
```
